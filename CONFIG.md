# searchTerms

> - Keywords: Test these in [https://bsky.app/search](https://bsky.app/search). `AND` is implicit, so `cat dog` on one line will require both `cat` and `dog`. You can use quotes as well `"hot dog"`.
> - Users: links such as `https://bsky.app/profile/why.bsky.team` will pull in the user's posts (but not replies or reposts).
> - Pinned posts: links such as `https://bsky.app/profile/saddymayo.bsky.social/post/3jxju2wwap22e` will pin at the top of the feed. One link per line, please.
